# Events Recommendation System
### Java Web Service Development

This events recommendation system is based on Ticket Master API. \\
Users can register and login to their own account, and get information of events nearby. Users can also click "heart" for the favorite events, and then the backend use this information to do item-based events recommendation for them. 
This system has been deployed on AWS EC2.
